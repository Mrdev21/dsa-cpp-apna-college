/*
Subarray vs Subsequence

1. Subarray is a continuous part of the array.
Number of subarrays of an array with n elements = nC2 + n = n*(n+1)/2
e.g. 123
Subarrays are: 1, 12, 123, 2, 23, 3
Number of subarrays = 6 = 3C2 + 3 = 3*(3+1)/2   

2. Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by selecting zero or more 
elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Number of subsequences of an array with n elements = 2^â€‹nâ€‹
e.g. 123
Subsequences are: {}, 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 23, 123
Number of subsequences = 8 = 2^3

Every subarray is a subsequence but every subsequence is not a subarray.
